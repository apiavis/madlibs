# Madlibs

## Overview
This project was part of my software development apprenticeship. The purpose of the project was to build out the back-end of an application; therefore, the front-end was already provided. The Madlibs app uses a node runtime with express to create a basic API that generates madlibs from the madlibs folder and JavaScript files.
